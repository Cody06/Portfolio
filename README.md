## Projects:

### Workboard

-   **Tools:** JavaScript / TypeScript, React, HTML and Tailwind CSS

### Social Networking

-   This project is still a work in progress.
-   **Tools:** JavaScript / TypeScript, React, HTML and Tailwind CSS

## To run it locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
